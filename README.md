# NBA Statistics R Shiny Application
Code for a R Shiny application that visualizes NBA player statistics for easy visual comparison.

A link to the application is [here](https://maxrodrigues17.shinyapps.io/nba-players-stats/)

## Data
The Players file and player data file contain information about each player including height, weight, and college. The seasons stats file contains various NBA statistics for every player with playing time from 1950-2017.

## R Files
The UI file builds the user interface of the Shiny application. The application allows the user to select a desired NBA statistic, an NBA player to compare, percentiles to see how a player compares to the rest of the league, and an option to view the entire timeline of data or if the user would like to compare the players directly. The server file prepares the data for visualization and builds the necessary plots.
